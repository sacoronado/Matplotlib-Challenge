# Pymaceutical Trials

## Observations

1. In the Capomulin trials, the weight of the rat and the tumor size are very closely related

2. Of the four regiments we were tasked with finding the means, all but one did not contain an outlier, which is a good indication that the tests were standard.

3. Although Capomulin had the lowest mean tumor volume in the end, given its strong correlation with mass it is possible that the mice lost a lot of weight during the trials.
